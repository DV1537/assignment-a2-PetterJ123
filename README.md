A2: Classes

Instructions:

    Implement an abstract class Shape with methods:
        getType() returns a string denoting type of a shape (point, line, polygon ..)
        area() returns area of the object, or -1 if the shape is concave, intersecting, or does not have an area
        circumreference() returns circumreference of the object
        position() returns center coordinates of the object
        isConvex() returns true if shape is convex
        distance(Shape s) returns distance to the center of another shape

    Extend the Object classe into Point, Line, Triangle, and Polygon. Overload the inherited methods. Constructors of these classes take vertices coordinates as an input.

    The program should load a shape from a file and output its surface area. The input file contains a series of real numbers indicating coordinates of vertices. Example:

1 2 3 4 5 6.43  // Denotes a triange with vertices at (1, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6.43) 

There should not be a limitation of how many points the program can load.

Example:

Input: 1 1 1 2 2 2  		Output: 0.5
Input: 1 3.4 3 3 13.13 3	Output: 2.026
Input: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 0	Output: 2.5
Input: 0 -10			Output: -1
